This is calendar to enhance people's learning processes. 

During the summer of 2025, I aimed to use spaced repetition and interleaved learning to enhance my own learning of computer science. While tools like Anki exist, they are limited to flashcards and a few other study formats. I needed to reorganize my schedule to optimize my learning speed and effectiveness, so I decided to build learningCalendar.

The aim is to provide other students with ways to learn and think better with proven ways to improve learning like spaced repetition, the Feynman technique, and other methods built into a calendar while pinpointing what the student's strengths and weaknesses are to adjust one's learning schedule accordingly.

To use the program, run `python main.py`.
